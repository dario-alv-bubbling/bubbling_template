## PROJECT LINTING

1. Run `pre-commit install` in order to install pre-commit hooks to the repo
2. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` in order to run code formatter (autopep8) and check for PEP8 compliance (flake8)

## Useful links:
The official [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) documentation provides a pretty good explanation on how things work.

Hook details can be found in [pre-commit Github repo](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)

A nice article about it:
[found here](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/)

## Basic hooks:

[flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8)
